    <h1>History</h1>

    <h3>Food banks have a rich history that dates back several decades. The concept of food banking emerged as a response to widespread hunger and food insecurity.</h3>

    <h4>Here's a brief overview of the history of food banks:</h4>

    <div class="his">
        <div><p class="p1">1. Origins in the 1960s: The roots of food banking can be traced back to the 1960s in the United States. John van Hengel, a retired businessman from Phoenix, Arizona, is often credited with founding the first food bank. Van Hengel noticed that local grocery stores were discarding edible food, while people in his community were going hungry. To address this, he established St. Mary's Food Bank in 1967, which became a model for future food banks.</p></div>
        
        <div><p class="p2">2 .Expansion in the 1970s: Food banking gained momentum in the 1970s as more organizations and individuals recognized the need to address hunger and food waste. The first network of food banks, Feeding America (formerly known as America's Second Harvest), was established in 1979. Feeding America played a pivotal role in coordinating food banks across the United States, fostering collaboration, and expanding their reach.</p></div>
        
        <div><p class="p3">3. Global Spread in the 1980s: The food bank concept spread beyond the United States in the 1980s. Canada saw the establishment of the first food bank in Edmonton, Alberta, in 1981. The Global FoodBanking Network (GFN), an international organization supporting food banks, was formed in 2006 to promote the establishment and growth of food banks worldwide.</p></div>
        
        <div><p class="p4">4. Response to Economic Crises: Food banks gained increased visibility and importance during times of economic downturns. For example, during the 2008 global financial crisis, many people faced unemployment and poverty, leading to a surge in demand for food assistance. Food banks played a critical role in providing support to vulnerable populations affected by the economic crisis.</p></div>
        
        <div><p class="p5">5. Diversification and Community Engagement: Over the years, food banks have evolved to become more than just distribution centers. They have increasingly focused on addressing the root causes of hunger by promoting nutrition education, offering job training programs, advocating for policy changes, and engaging in community-building initiatives.</p></div>
    </div>
    <h3> Today, food banks are prevalent in many countries worldwide, providing essential food assistance to individuals and families in need. They rely on partnerships with food retailers, manufacturers, farmers, and individual donors to acquire and distribute food to those facing food insecurity. Additionally, food banks often collaborate with government agencies, non-profit organizations, and volunteers to address the complex issue of hunger in their communities.</h3>
